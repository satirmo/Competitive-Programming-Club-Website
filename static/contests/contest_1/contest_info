Our first contest of the semester featured two of our veterans, Neel and Santosh. Both managed to solve Problem A before the first minute expired. However, it was Neel who managed to establish an early lead by solving his second problem at the 7 minute mark. Santosh took an unorthodox approach by attempting to solve the more difficult Problem G. Ultimately, it was Neel who managed to win the contest with a convincing one-problem lead. Congratulations for winning the first contest of the semester, Neel!
